acesora:sigh:I've got you. Virus-R. I'm way too familiar with your aura.
r:sweat:Damn it... Of course I'm found again...
acesora:normal:For the sake of this game's stability, I had to come all by myself. Just why are you such a difficult one to take care of?
acesora:smile:But for the sake of these two little friends you just made, you wouldn't want to fight with me, right?
bf:afraid:Hey! I'm 19!!!
r:angry:I... I'll go with you.
acesora:sigh:You should've done that ages ago.
bf:normal:I object! Why are you trying to capture her! She didn't do anything wrong!
acesora:impatient:She is a virus, never meant to exist in the system. This alone, is enough for her sin.
bf:awesome:Come on, she's our friend! There's no way I'm gonna let you take her, you gotta get over me first!
